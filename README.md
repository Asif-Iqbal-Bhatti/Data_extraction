## Overview

This repository provides a reproducible pipeline for:

- Extracting and refining data from the Materials Project and Matbench Discovery leaderboard.
- Building and training machine learning models to predict properties of inorganic crystals.
- Applying these models to accelerate the discovery of new battery materials.

## Features

- Automated Data Extraction: Scripts to pull and preprocess data from open-source databases.
- Data Refinement: Cleaning, filtering, and feature engineering for high-quality datasets.
- Model Development: Training and evaluation of state-of-the-art ML models (e.g., GNNs, Bayesian optimizers).
- Battery Application: Workflow for screening and predicting promising battery materials using Matbench Discovery metrics.
